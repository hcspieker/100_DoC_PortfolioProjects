# "100 Days of Code" Portfolio Projects

This repository features projects I developed during days 82 to 100 of the Udemy course "100 Days of Code".

## Day 82 - String to Morse

The exercise on day 82 involved creating a text-based converter that converts strings into Morse code. In my solution, I developed a simple console program that loads the input argument, converts it to its Morse code representation and returns the result.

Run this program: py D82_StringToMorse\main.py "example text."
