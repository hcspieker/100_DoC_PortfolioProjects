# "100 Days of Code" Portfolio Projects

This repository features projects I developed during days 82 to 100 of the Udemy course "100 Days of Code".

## Day 82 - String to Morse

The exercise on day 82 involved creating a text-based converter that converts strings into Morse code. In my solution, I developed a simple console program that loads the input argument, converts it to its Morse code representation and returns the result.

### Usage  
To run the program, use the following command:  

```powershell
py D82_StringToMorse\main.py "example text."  
```

## Day 84 - Tic Tac Toe

The task of this day was to build a text based tic tac toe game.

### Features

- Two game modes: PvP (Player vs Player) and PvC (Player vs Computer)
- Includes a temporary scoreboard
- Detects if someone has won the current game or if its a tie
- Includes a algorithm to handle computer turns

### Usage  
To start the Game, use the following command:  

```powershell
py D84_TextBasedTicTacToe\main.py
```
